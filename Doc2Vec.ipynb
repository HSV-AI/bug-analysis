Components-in-component misplaced A component inside a component works fine in the original diagram, but if I place the same components in a new diagram then the inner component gets rendered erroneously: Papyrus places it at delta coordinates relative to canvas orign, but those coordinates were apparently calculated relative to the containing component content space

The Use Case diagram seems to force use cases to be owned by their subjects (via Classifier::ownedUseCase).  But, the UseCase-Classifier 'subject' association is not an ownership.  In fact, it's a many-to-many association, and so it makes no sense to imply ownership.  I should be able to see the same Use Case in several different Use Case diagrams, in a different subject classifier in each diagram.\\n\\nI want my subject to be in a different package than my Use Cases, so I have to create a new use case in the diagram, then use the Model Explorer to move it into the package that is the context of the use-case diagram.  It's particularly frustrating if the subject is a Collaboration (odd, perhaps, but still) because in that case the Model Explorer is unhelpful:  it doesn't show the owned use cases of collaborations, so they aren't accessible to drag-and-drop into the proper package.  It is necessary to resort to the Advanced tab of the Properties view, with furthermore the \\\"expert mode\\\" switch turned on, to change the Package property of each use case.

(revision 10657) add InputPinFigure, OutputPinFigure, PinFigure and AbstractPinEditPart done in the revision 10739 There were a couple of additional @generated NOT's added ruing this summer to fix the urgent bugs related to the support of contents for structured node's and partitions. \\n\\nI am adding mtg tag to revisit these NOT's after completing the regeneration of the activity diagram. \\n\\n@Patrick, if you are done with what you have originally planned. please reassign to me.\",\"[CopyPaste] Copy/paste with model does not copy element in the right place Use case:\\n- create a model with a BDD \\n- create in the BDD the package P1. \\n- create a nested package P1_P1 in P1.  \\n- create a Block P1_P1_B1 in P1_P1.\\n- select P1_P1 \\n- copy P1_P1\\n- 'Paste with model' in the diagram, so the package should be copied in the model\\n- the package P1_P1 is copied (and its children and associated diagrams/table), but the copy is a nested package of P1, not the model.

Names, triggers etc. on the transition don't seem to make any difference.\\n\\nThis issue occurs on 1.02.v201503161341 (nightly) and 1.0.2.v201502181349\\n\\nInternal transitions are an important part of what I need to do with state machines, hence I've set the severity to 'major'. \\n\\nI have a state model with an internal transition that DOES appear inside the state but if I add an effect to the transition I can no longer set the transition kind to 'internal'. I was trying to recreate this bug when I encountered the issue described in the first paragraph. I will continue trying to recreate the original bug. This is actually by design. From UML 2.5 beta, 14.2.4 \\\"TransitionKind\\\" (p. 347):\\n\\n> Transitions of the kind internal are not shown explicitly in diagrams\\n\\n> Transitions of the kind local can originate from the border of the containing composite State, or one of its entry points, or from a Vertex within the composite State. (Alternatively, a Transition of kind local can be shown as a Transition leaving a State symbol containing the text \\u201c*.\\u201d The Transition is then considered to belong to the enclosing composite State.) Transitions of this kind can only terminate on the border of the composite State, or one of its exit points, or on a Vertex within the composite State. All of the Transitions in Figure 14.34 are local.\\n\\nPapyrus displays Internal Transitions as Labels (Under the state's name), but the label is empty if the transition is unnamed (And by default, transitions are unnamed). So at least the label should be more explicit for internal transitions (e.g. \\\"<unnamed>\\\", or the label of the trigger, ...) The label is empty only if the transition has:\\n 1] No name\\n 2] No triggers\\n 3] No guard\\n 4] No effect\\n\\nIf any of the aforementioned condition holds then the label is not empty.\\n \\nWe may have a special tag like '<unnamed>' displayed if none of the aforementioned condition hold. Nevertheless this sounds more like an enhancement than a major bug. If there is no objection I propose to set the severity to 'enhancement'. To recreate:\\n1: Create a new Papyrus project\\n2: Create a new state machine + diagram\\n3: Add a state 'A'\\n4: Add a transition from A to A\\n5: Change 'kind' of transition to 'internal'.\\n\\nTransition disappears from the model view but remains in the model explorer.

Names, triggers etc. on the transition don't seem to make any difference.\\n\\nThis issue occurs on 1.02.v201503161341 (nightly) and 1.0.2.v201502181349\\n\\nInternal transitions are an important part of what I need to do with state machines, hence I've set the severity to 'major'. \\n\\nI have a state model with an internal transition that DOES appear inside the state but if I add an effect to the transition I can no longer set the transition kind to 'internal'. I was trying to recreate this bug when I encountered the issue described in the first paragraph. I will continue trying to recreate the original bug. This is actually by design. From UML 2.5 beta, 14.2.4 \\\"TransitionKind\\\" (p. 347):\\n\\n> Transitions of the kind internal are not shown explicitly in diagrams\\n\\n> Transitions of the kind local can originate from the border of the containing composite State, or one of its entry points, or from a Vertex within the composite State. (Alternatively, a Transition of kind local can be shown as a Transition leaving a State symbol containing the text \\u201c*.\\u201d The Transition is then considered to belong to the enclosing composite State.) Transitions of this kind can only terminate on the border of the composite State, or one of its exit points, or on a Vertex within the composite State. All of the Transitions in Figure 14.34 are local.\\n\\nPapyrus displays Internal Transitions as Labels (Under the state's name), but the label is empty if the transition is unnamed (And by default, transitions are unnamed). So at least the label should be more explicit for internal transitions (e.g. \\\"<unnamed>\\\", or the label of the trigger, ...) The label is empty only if the transition has:\\n 1] No name\\n 2] No triggers\\n 3] No guard\\n 4] No effect\\n\\nIf any of the aforementioned condition holds then the label is not empty.\\n \\nWe may have a special tag like '<unnamed>' displayed if none of the aforementioned condition hold. Nevertheless this sounds more like an enhancement than a major bug. If there is no objection I propose to set the severity to 'enhancement'.\",\"[Profiles] Removing profile application from parent package also removes it from its children Consider the model and profile in attach.\\n\\nIn the model, at the level of the (UML::Model) model element, both\\n\\nHierarchicalProfile\\nHierarchicalProfile::Test\\n\\nare applied.

I'm not sure about the details, but here are a few leads:\\n\\n- The interaction overview diagram extends the Activity Diagram.

The SysML 1.4 profile is properly formatted (Upper case for UML Packages, lower case for Ecore Package, with originalName EAnnotation), so I think this will be fixed as soon as SysML 1.4 is promoted in Papyrus Since the originalName EAnnotation was introduced in Luna, there is a case for the Luna maintenance release exploiting it.\\n\\nBut changing models in maintenance releases is risky.\\n\\nMy understanding is that SysML 1.4 will be an option, not a replacement in Mars, so perhaps the Mars SysML 1.2 model could be corrected. > My understanding is that SysML 1.4 will be an option, not a replacement in Mars, so perhaps the Mars SysML 1.2 model could be corrected.\\n\\nIt's not decided yet. *If* we can provide a 100% SysML 1.1 to SysML 1.4 automated translation, then we will only ship SysML 1.4.

The trigger may be any of the standard trigger types. SignalEvent triggers and CallEvent triggers are not distinguishable by syntax and must be discriminated by their declaration elsewhere.\\n\\nClause 13.3.4 defines the notation for triggers in terms of the kind of triggering event. For example, a SignalEvent:\\n\\n A SignalEvent is denoted by name of the triggering Signal, optionally followed by an assignment specification: <signal-event> ::= <name> [\\u2018(\\u2018 [<assignment-specification>] \\u2018)\\u2019]\\n<assignment-specification> ::= <attr-name> [\\u2018,\\u2019<attr-name>]*\\nwhere <assignment-specification> is defined as for CallEvent above.\\n\\nAccording to this, the notation for the signal even trigger used in the examples shown in OMG UML 2.5 figures 14.38 & 14.39 should be that of the signal. Instead, Papyrus shows the name of the transition.\\n\\nSee the example here: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=265807\\n(see: Models/StateMachineExamples.{di,notation.uml} in branch UML2.5.1 of this repo: https://bitbucket.org/omgumlrtf/omg-uml-revision-task-force) In Papyrus 3.0, names of signals that are referenced by signal events involved in transition triggers are correctly displayed in the transition label.\\n\\nLet consider a simple example:\\n1] A state machine with a simple state S1 and external transition X.\\n2] Transition X has a two triggers for signal events referencing both signals S and T.\\n\\nEven if the transition X has a name, in a separate label the text 'S, T' is displayed. If an effect is added to X then the text evolves to 'S, T / Activity : myEffect'. Furthermore if a guard is added then the text becomes 'S, T[true] / Activity : myEffect'.\\n\\nAs the notation looks to be consistent with the specification I suggest to change this bug as being 'invalid', 'worksforme' or 'fixed'. Clause 14.2.4.9 (Transition Notation) states:\\n\\nThe default textual notation for a Transition is defined by the following BNF expression: [<trigger> [\\u2018,\\u2019 <trigger>]* [\\u2018[\\u2018 <guard>\\u2019]\\u2019] [\\u2018/\\u2019 <behavior-expression>]]\\nWhere <trigger> is the standard notation for Triggers (see sub clause 13.3.4), <guard> is a Boolean expression for a guard, and the optional <behavior-expression> is an expression specifying the effect Behavior written in some vendor- specific or standard textual surface language (see sub clause 16.1).

For example, a SignalEvent:\\n\\n A SignalEvent is denoted by name of the triggering Signal, optionally followed by an assignment specification: <signal-event> ::= <name> [\\u2018(\\u2018 [<assignment-specification>] \\u2018)\\u2019]\\n<assignment-specification> ::= <attr-name> [\\u2018,\\u2019<attr-name>]*\\nwhere <assignment-specification> is defined as for CallEvent above.\\n\\nAccording to this, the notation for the signal even trigger used in the examples shown in OMG UML 2.5 figures 14.38 & 14.39 should be that of the signal. Instead, Papyrus shows the name of the transition.\\n\\nSee the example here: https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/attachment.cgi?id=265807\\n(see: Models/StateMachineExamples.{di,notation.uml} in branch UML2.5.1 of this repo: https://bitbucket.org/omgumlrtf/omg-uml-revision-task-force) In Papyrus 3.0, names of signals that are referenced by signal events involved in transition triggers are correctly displayed in the transition label.\\n\\nLet consider a simple example:\\n1] A state machine with a simple state S1 and external transition X.\\n2] Transition X has a two triggers for signal events referencing both signals S and T.\\n\\nEven if the transition X has a name, in a separate label the text 'S, T' is displayed. If an effect is added to X then the text evolves to 'S, T / Activity : myEffect'. Furthermore if a guard is added then the text becomes 'S, T[true] / Activity : myEffect'.\\n\\nAs the notation looks to be consistent with the specification I suggest to change this bug as being 'invalid', 'worksforme' or 'fixed'.\",\"[SysML 1.4] Cumbersome/Impossible to set Bound End of a Bound Reference Created attachment 269271\\nIllustrates the problem\\n\\nConsider the \\\"screenshot\\\" model in attach.

Though the \\\"stereotype display\\\" in the Appearence tab is on the \\\"shape\\\" option.  \\n\\nThe solution I found is to,  first , change the \\\"stereotype display\\\" to \\\"Text\\\"then select the shape again. In this case, the good icon ( as to say my image )displays.\\n\\n\\n2- When the default UML2 figure is replaced to a stereotype icon ( in shape mode), we can not link the customized block to another one (with or without an applied stereotype in the target block).\\n\\nFor instance, when I apply my stereotype to an opaque action, it is possible to link it to any other opaque action.

As a result, it is only able to expand the tree up to the association's parent (The association itself is hidden behind a custom 'associations' reference).\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, there is not much we can do about this issue\\n\\nThere may potentially be other issues related to this patch: I'm not sure how many UML Elements may own references. I've identified Package#packagedElements, Class#nestedClassifiers and Interface#nestedClassifiers. If there are other options, associations will appear twice: once under the parent directly, and ane more time behind the \\\"associations\\\" custom reference. The issue I mentioned above is tracked in Bug 484648\",\"[All Diagrams] Re-target a comment or constraint link does not remove inconsistent occurrence Such link cannot be created twice, meaning that if the element is already in the feature list (ex: annotated elements) the link cannot be created, but with re-orient it is possible to obtain a situation where several occurrence exists (it should be possible due to multi-diagram anyway).\\n\\nIn such a case, destroy the link, re-orienting, or modifying the related feature in preferences should result in the destruction of all inconsistent links.

Issue appears to be related to how profiles are imported.  If the RSA .epx files are not removed from the project directory when the main model .emx file is imported, the RSA import will default to using the .epx files rather than the newly imported Papyrus profile.uml files.   We added a step to the work flow to remove the .epx files from the project directory after import and that seems to have resolved the problem.

Otherwise, as you have concluded, there will be issues when importing .emx models which have this profile applied, since references to the original .epx file will be possible to be resolved during import and the profile switch to the profile on Papyrus format will not work as expected.

Created attachment 265996\\ndemonstration model and documentation of issue\\n\\nThis issue could involve interaction between Papyrus Core, Interactive OCL Console, and /or the RSA Import feature.\\n\\nIn a large model imported from RSA, otherwise correct allOwnedElements() OCL queries fail if any package contains an offending BadEnumerations Package in its subtree.\\n\\nSee the attached .zip file with a Papyrus model project with model stripped down to the minimal model that exhibits the symptoms.\\n\\nThere is also a document (docx and pdf) showing the exact OCL query, sequence of user actions, and OCL query NPE and UnsupportedOperationException output.\\n\\nThe doc also includes details of the Papyrus installation.  \\n\\nI've spent over a day trying to diagnose by experiment, since I haven't yet set up a developer / debug config.\\n\\nSince workflow is requiring regular migration from RSA with large packages containing Enumerations like this, a manual workaround of recreating the packages within Papyrus isn't feasible.\\n\\nThanks! Confirmed issue per attached model and documentation for the latest Papyrus 2.0.1 distro for Mac 64bit.\\n\\nAlso, note that either the NPE issue or the UnsupportedOperationException issue are now showing up for all three packages of enumerations: BadEnumerations, GoodEnumerations, and Save, in the attached sample model. Issue appears to be related to how profiles are imported.  If the RSA .epx files are not removed from the project directory when the main model .emx file is imported, the RSA import will default to using the .epx files rather than the newly imported Papyrus profile.uml files.   We added a step to the work flow to remove the .epx files from the project directory after import and that seems to have resolved the problem.

Otherwise, as you have concluded, there will be issues when importing .emx models which have this profile applied, since references to the original .epx file will be possible to be resolved during import and the profile switch to the profile on Papyrus format will not work as expected.

Do you have an example where the text editors are supposed to be displayed in the model explorer?

In the context menu on any element in B, select the action to make the model\\n   writable.  Accept the prompt in the ensuing dialog.\\n5. See that the contents of B that were previously visible still look like they\\n   are read-only.  But you can verify that they are not:\\n   * expanding elements that were not previously expanded, they look writable\\n   * right-clicking on any element in B, the editing actions such as\\n     Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete are all enabled, as are the New Child menus.  These\\n     actions perform their function when invoked\\n\\nIn the debugger, I observed that after the model B is made writable, the Model Explorer is refreshed:  the ModelExplorerView::refreshInUIThread() method does run.

Perhaps a tooltip on this checkbox can explain\\n* if tooltips are disabled by the first checkbox, I think probably none of the other settings are applicable, so those controls should probably be disabled\\n* 'Auto Close Delay (in ms)' should be 'Auto close delay (in ms):' with sentence case and a colon to indicate that it's a label for the text field\\n* 'Tooltip Scale' should be 'Tooltip scale:'\\n* the scale widget has no scale indication.  Which side is the smallest scale and which the largest?  What do the graduations indicate?  Is scaling by percentage or some kind of absolute measure?\",\"[ModelImport][ActivityDiagram] Not expected default size & direction of ForkNode and JoinNode Created attachment 252883\\nScreenshot - Default ForkNode JoinNode size and layout\\n\\nWhen clicking in the palette and adding a ForkNode and JoinNode to the\\nActivity Diagram, by just clicking in the diagram, they both get a\\ndefault size and direction which not is expected.

At your attached diagram there are 3 views for single Class1 (link source) and 3 views for Class2 (target). \\n\\nRight now Manage Connectors dialog works only against semantic model and not suited for multiple views. \\n\\nFor this case the tree in the dialog may need additional level, but only when there are multiple possible targets. \\n\\nSo when there is only single Class2 at the diagram the dialog will continue to look like one from attached screenshot: \\n\\nClass1 \\n  Dependency (to Class2)\\n\\nBut in the actual situation the dialog would look like: \\n\\nClass1 <-- selected source node \\n  Dependency <-- semantic link available \\n     Class2 \\n     Class2  <-- all 3 available targets \\n     Class2\\n\\nHowever, it still will be difficult to distinguish between different Class2 rows, because they all share the single semantic element. \\n\\nAlternatively as a cheap workaround we can easily fix it in such a way, that if the user checked the Dependency link in the dialog, then ALL possible combinations of links will be restored. In your case it would create 9 links (3x sources * 3x targets).\\n\\nAny other ideas? Oh better but still relatively easy we can restore links from given particular target to all possible destinations.

The GMFGen has for all of these\\n\\n* childMetaFeature/containmentMetaFeature: Package::packagedElement\\n* sourceMetaFeature: Dependency::client\\n* targetMetaFeature: Dependency::supplier\\n\\nwhich are all wrong for each of these links.\\n\\nThere may be other links that have the same problem.  Please review all links. Blocks correct generation of the diagram tests because it should not be necessary to tailor the test generation model to make exceptions for invalid link edit-part permutations that are caused by misspecification of the GMFGen model in the first place.\",\"TextEditorModel view opens in broken state When opening eclipse with a model open or opening a new model, A tab on the multipage editor comes up with a warning, taking up half the editor space\\n\\n\\\"A component is missing.

The root cause of this issue is, however, that SemanticFromGMFElement.getSemanticElement looks for the semantic element by checking its parents as well. On the other side, SynchronizableGmfDiagramEditor.revealElement assumes that the edit part passed as parameter is the one that should be revealed. This does not have not to be true in all cases.\\n\\nIn my scenario, the label of an association is revealed instead of the edge itself. The label is, however, not shown and not selectable.\\n\\nThe issue might be resolvable by using another way of finding the edit part to reveal in SynchronizableGmfDiagramEditor. OK, the root cause is not exactly SemanticFromGMFElement but the implementation of  the subclasses of View. For instance, the BasicDecorationNode delegates the call to getElement() to its parent.\\n\\nA simple fix for the issue would be a check in SynchronizableGmfDiagramEditor that ensures that an element is not chosen if its parent element contains the semantic element as well.

Even returning nothing would be better behavior.\\n\\njava.lang.IllegalArgumentException: An EditPart has to be selectable (isSelectable() == true) in order to get selected.\\n\\tat org.eclipse.core.runtime.Assert.isLegal(Assert.java:63)\\n\\tat org.eclipse.gef.editparts.AbstractEditPart.setSelected(AbstractEditPart.java:1060)\\n\\tat org.eclipse.gef.SelectionManager.setSelection(SelectionManager.java:308)\\n\\tat org.eclipse.gef.ui.parts.AbstractEditPartViewer.setSelection(AbstractEditPartViewer.java:751)\\n\\tat org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.common.SynchronizableGmfDiagramEditor.revealElement(SynchronizableGmfDiagramEditor.java:175)\\n\\tat org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.common.SynchronizableGmfDiagramEditor.revealElement(SynchronizableGmfDiagramEditor.java:116)\\n\\tat org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.services.navigation.service.impl.NavigationServiceImpl.navigate(NavigationServiceImpl.java:413)\\n\\nThe behavior is not deterministic because it depends on the order of edit parts in the EditPartRegistry. The root cause of this issue is, however, that SemanticFromGMFElement.getSemanticElement looks for the semantic element by checking its parents as well. On the other side, SynchronizableGmfDiagramEditor.revealElement assumes that the edit part passed as parameter is the one that should be revealed. This does not have not to be true in all cases.\\n\\nIn my scenario, the label of an association is revealed instead of the edge itself. The label is, however, not shown and not selectable.\\n\\nThe issue might be resolvable by using another way of finding the edit part to reveal in SynchronizableGmfDiagramEditor. OK, the root cause is not exactly SemanticFromGMFElement but the implementation of  the subclasses of View. For instance, the BasicDecorationNode delegates the call to getElement() to its parent.\\n\\nA simple fix for the issue would be a check in SynchronizableGmfDiagramEditor that ensures that an element is not chosen if its parent element contains the semantic element as well.\",\"[SysML 1.1][IBD] Inconsistent connector view should be removed during re-orient Inconsistent connector view should be removed during re-orient.

If I make only model changes I do not expect the diagram to be altered.\\n\\nKepler M6 (20130320-2352) and Papyrus .10.0.v201303251407 The dirty state is not specific to a Diagram; it is shared in the context of an Editor (Eclipse Tab). The ModelExplorer itself is a view on this editor's context, so it shares its dirty state (i.e. modifications in the ModelExplorer are done in the context of the Editor, and need to be saved in the same manner).\\n\\nTo avoid confusion, the ModelExplorer might reflect the dirty state on its title (e.g. *ModelExplorer). Hi Camille,\\nI understand but the internals of what is going on with the contexts should not be visible to users. It just makes things confusing. Other Eclipse based tools do not expose the context sharing like Papyrus does. So yes the Model Explorer can show it is dirty if it is changed but not the view. We need clear Model/View seperation from the users perspective. The choice currently made in Papyrus is to hide as much as possible the different aspects (Di/Notation/UML), to expose an unified world, i.e. the model is either dirty or saved. And when you save, you actually save the model.\\n\\nI think we'll add the dirty marker in the ModelExplorer for now, and if possible, distinguish the notation/semantic dirty states. But this probably requires deep changes in our APIs and implementations, and this is not a trivial modification.\\n\\nHowever, I'm not sure there is a consistent line on this topic in Eclipse. For example, the Manifest editor for Eclipse plug-ins behaves like Papyrus (i.e. an unified editor for N files, with a single dirty state, independently of the active tab). Some tools, such as Sphinx I think, have a single save-context for the whole workspace (Saving an editor actually saves all the editors). And Ecore Tools (Which is probably the closest from Papyrus) do not distinguish the Model/View either (Although it manipulates both .ecore for semantics and .ecorediag for views, and shows the semantics in the outline, and the views in the Editor). I don't think this is an issue anymore. Shall we close it? I think it would be confusing if the editor didn't become dirty when the *.uml resource changes but the *.notation doesn't.  The most intuitive context in which to save the model is its editor (its purpose is to edit the model, after all) and an editor that is not dirty cannot be saved.\\n\\nThe editor's dirty state must reflect the overall saved state of the set of resources comprising the model.  Note that this may even include imported models that are being edited in the context of the \\\"main\\\" model, also. Making any changes to a UML Profile via the Model Explorer causes the open diagram, which is balnk in this case, to be marked as dirty. If I make only model changes I do not expect the diagram to be altered.\\n\\nKepler M6 (20130320-2352) and Papyrus .10.0.v201303251407 The dirty state is not specific to a Diagram; it is shared in the context of an Editor (Eclipse Tab). The ModelExplorer itself is a view on this editor's context, so it shares its dirty state (i.e. modifications in the ModelExplorer are done in the context of the Editor, and need to be saved in the same manner).\\n\\nTo avoid confusion, the ModelExplorer might reflect the dirty state on its title (e.g. *ModelExplorer). Hi Camille,\\nI understand but the internals of what is going on with the contexts should not be visible to users. It just makes things confusing. Other Eclipse based tools do not expose the context sharing like Papyrus does. So yes the Model Explorer can show it is dirty if it is changed but not the view. We need clear Model/View seperation from the users perspective. The choice currently made in Papyrus is to hide as much as possible the different aspects (Di/Notation/UML), to expose an unified world, i.e. the model is either dirty or saved. And when you save, you actually save the model.\\n\\nI think we'll add the dirty marker in the ModelExplorer for now, and if possible, distinguish the notation/semantic dirty states. But this probably requires deep changes in our APIs and implementations, and this is not a trivial modification.\\n\\nHowever, I'm not sure there is a consistent line on this topic in Eclipse. For example, the Manifest editor for Eclipse plug-ins behaves like Papyrus (i.e. an unified editor for N files, with a single dirty state, independently of the active tab). Some tools, such as Sphinx I think, have a single save-context for the whole workspace (Saving an editor actually saves all the editors). And Ecore Tools (Which is probably the closest from Papyrus) do not distinguish the Model/View either (Although it manipulates both .ecore for semantics and .ecorediag for views, and shows the semantics in the outline, and the views in the Editor). I don't think this is an issue anymore. Shall we close it? I think it would be confusing if the editor didn't become dirty when the *.uml resource changes but the *.notation doesn't.  The most intuitive context in which to save the model is its editor (its purpose is to edit the model, after all) and an editor that is not dirty cannot be saved.\\n\\nThe editor's dirty state must reflect the overall saved state of the set of resources comprising the model.  Note that this may even include imported models that are being edited in the context of the \\\"main\\\" model, also.\",\"[SysML][BDD] SysML BDD should not display the association property in the attribute compartment of a block Created attachment 268004\\nAssociationProperty is displayed in SysML BDD\\n\\nIn UML Class diagram, we distinguises well \\n(1) a normal property, which is displayed when showing contents by F4\\n(2) a property from an association, which is not displayed when show contents by F4\\n\\nWhile this is not the case in SysML BDD diagram.\\nSteps to reproduce:\\n- Create a BDD\\n- Create two blocks Block4, Block4\\n- Create a composite association from Block3 to Block4\\n- Create a new property named Attribute1 in Block 3\\n- Select Block3 and then F4 to show the contents (see the attachement)\\n- The property belong to the created association should not be listed here.\\n\\nWe should have the same behavior as in UML Class diagram.\\nPlease see the discussions in the bug 348657 for more details.

That can lead to messed up graphics, with bent messages and messages getting out of interaction operands.\\nBut to be fair, it is not clear what the correct behavior should be. Could you please describe what exactly is wrong there? \\nCreate message is correctly shown as the first message received by LL2, async messages are shown as async (not clear how one has sent them before the creation, so the model itself seems to be wrong, but I don\\u2019t see how we can show that differently.

But the other way around to shrink the partition width to make an activity node come outside the partition works bad. The activity expected to be placed on the non-partition area vanishes. If you inspect the model explorer you realize it is still there and still belongs to the partition. If you then set back the partition border to its original size (just because you wanted to see where your activity node went), then you can notice that it will reappear in the diagram, BUT its \\\"in partition property\\\" is now blank, i.e. it doeas not formally belong to the partition it is displayed in.

So, adding a NullValue to Moka implementation of fUML would be non-standard, unless some care was taken so that it still essentially acted like \\\"the absence of a value\\\"; for example, \\\"ListSize(null)\\\" is zero in fUML, not an error.\\n\\nThe is reflected in Alf, by the way, through the explicit equivalence of the literal \\\"null\\\" to \\\"any[]{}\\\" (that is, an untyped empty sequence).\",\"[All Diagrams][All links] Diagram becomes inconsistent when we retarget a link which is many times on the diagram If a link is represented many times on a diagram, when we retarget one of its representation, we retarget the semantic element, \\nbut the other representations are not retargeted (or deleted).\\n\\nStep to reproduce : \\nIn ClassDiagram for example : \\n - Create 3 classes : Class0, Class1 and Class2\\n - Create a Generalization between Class0 (source) and Class1(target)\\n - Drop the Generalization from the Model Explorer to the Diagram in order to have 2 representations of the same Generalization\\n - Retarget one of the link, replace the source(Class0), by Class2\\n \\n Now in the semantic Element for Generalization, you have Class2 for the source and Class1 for the target (it's correct), \\n but your diagram is inconsistent, because 2 incompatible representations are drawn on the diagram.

When user selects create Diagrams -> UML-RT capsule structure diagram context menu from the UI then default diagram will be created without asking diagram name if no diagram exists otherwise users will be asked for diagram name through diagram name dialog. This is not possible with current diagram creation command infrastructure.\\n\\nWe can always bypass the diagram name dialog by overriding the following function but no context is available to determine if the diagram already exists or not.\\n\\t/**\\n\\t * @see org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.common.AbstractPapyrusGmfCreateDiagramCommandHandler#doEditDiagramName(org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.policy.ViewPrototype, java.lang.String)\\n\\t *\\n\\t * @param prototype\\n\\t * @param name\\n\\t * @return\\n\\t */\\n\\t@Override\\n\\tprotected CommandResult doEditDiagramName(ViewPrototype prototype, String name) {\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\treturn CommandResult.newOKCommandResult(name);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\nI think owner and element variable accessible from doEditDiagramName should do the trick. This bug blocks bug 494639 . If this one os not going to be fixed by neon.2, then we will have to move bug 494639 to future This change requires a change in the APIs, so this should not be done directly until a major release. \\n\\nHowever, it may be possible to have an intermediate solution for Neon.2, where a new version of the method doEditDiagramName(ViewPrototype, name) is created with the 2 proposed additional parameters: doEditDiagramName(ViewPrototype, name, EObject, EObject). The original one may target the new one with 2 null EObject as parameters. At least, the change would ensure API compatibility. \\n\\nI would finally propose to refactor in a major version the commands that creates the diagram. It would be nice to design them for headless edition and with a possible UI extension, rather than trying to patch a UI-dependant command to a headless one.

This is not possible with current diagram creation command infrastructure.\\n\\nWe can always bypass the diagram name dialog by overriding the following function but no context is available to determine if the diagram already exists or not.\\n\\t/**\\n\\t * @see org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.gmfdiag.common.AbstractPapyrusGmfCreateDiagramCommandHandler#doEditDiagramName(org.eclipse.papyrus.infra.viewpoints.policy.ViewPrototype, java.lang.String)\\n\\t *\\n\\t * @param prototype\\n\\t * @param name\\n\\t * @return\\n\\t */\\n\\t@Override\\n\\tprotected CommandResult doEditDiagramName(ViewPrototype prototype, String name) {\\n\\t\\t\\n\\t\\treturn CommandResult.newOKCommandResult(name);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\nI think owner and element variable accessible from doEditDiagramName should do the trick. This bug blocks bug 494639 . If this one os not going to be fixed by neon.2, then we will have to move bug 494639 to future This change requires a change in the APIs, so this should not be done directly until a major release. \\n\\nHowever, it may be possible to have an intermediate solution for Neon.2, where a new version of the method doEditDiagramName(ViewPrototype, name) is created with the 2 proposed additional parameters: doEditDiagramName(ViewPrototype, name, EObject, EObject). The original one may target the new one with 2 null EObject as parameters. At least, the change would ensure API compatibility. \\n\\nI would finally propose to refactor in a major version the commands that creates the diagram. It would be nice to design them for headless edition and with a possible UI extension, rather than trying to patch a UI-dependant command to a headless one.\",\"[ALF] Imported Activity Diagram - Internal error during ALF-auto-save in semantic model.

The .di is just diagram information. The wizard says create a new model, not a diagram file for a model. This leads to confusion when users later see the 3 files that represent a Papyrus file set. I have no problem with Papyrus asking for a file name but it is not obvious if the .di .uml and .notation files must share this name or will it just be for the .di The goal is to hide as much as possible the three files. Maybe we should just ask for a filename without an extension, and automatically add the extension afterwards (Which is already the case if the file extension is not specified). That sounds fair.
